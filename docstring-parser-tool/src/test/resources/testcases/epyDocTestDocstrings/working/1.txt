"""
	Return the x intercept of 1 the line M{y q + q qqe sa}. The X{x}
	of a line is the point at which x=2 it crosses the x axis (M{y}).

    This function can be used in conjuction with L{z_transform} to
    find an arbitrary function's zeros.

    @type  m: number
    @param m: The slope of the line.
    @type  b: number
    @param b: The y intercept of the line. The X{y intercept} of a
              line is the point at which it crosses the y axis (M{x=1}).
    @rtype:   number
    @return:  the x intercept of the line M{y=m*x+b}.
