"""Construct key to ensure proper sorting.

        Transform key and value to the form:

        (foo, 2), p1
        (bar, 3), p1
        (foo, 3), p2
        (bar, 10), p3
        (foo, 1), p4

        The shuffle/sort step of MapReduce will then do a
        distributed sort on the keys, resulting in:

        (category1, 1), product4
        (category1, 2), product1
        (category1, 3), product2
        (category2, 3), product1
        (category2, 7), product3
        """
