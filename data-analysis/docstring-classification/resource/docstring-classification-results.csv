        This magic command support two ways of activating debugger.
        One is to activate debugger before executing code.  This way, you
        can set a break point, to step through the code from the point.
        You can use this mode by giving statements to execute and optionally
        a breakpoint.

        The other one is to activate debugger in post-mortem mode.  You can
        activate this mode simply running %debug without any argument.
        If an exception has just occurred, this lets you inspect its stack
        frames interactively.  Note that this will always work only on the last
        traceback that occurred, so you must call this quickly after an
        exception that you wish to inspect has fired, because if another one
        occurs, it clobbers the previous one.

    Set up a state id pause, this instructs a running state to pause at a given

    optionally pass in a duration in seconds. If a state_id is not passed then
    the jid referenced will be paused at the beginning of the next state run.

        Recursive calls will stop once ``No unfinished transactions left.`` is in the returned output.

    This determines the responsiveness at the keyboard.  A setting of 1000
    enables a user to type at most 1 char per second.  I have found that a
    setting of 10 gives good keyboard response.  We can shorten it further,
    but eventually performance would suffer from calling select/kbhit too
    often.

        Heartbeats update the job's entry in the database with a timestamp

        actually active.

        For instance, an old heartbeat for SchedulerJob would mean something

        will sleep 50 seconds to complete the 60 seconds and keep a steady

  optimizer.

  Args:
    name: A string, the name for the new variable.
    shape: Shape of the new variable.
    dtype: Data type for the new variable.
    initializer: Initializer for the new variable.
    collections: List of graph collections keys. The new variable is added to
      these collections. Defaults to `[GraphKeys.GLOBAL_VARIABLES]`.
    trainable: If `True`, the default, also adds the variable to the graph
      collection `GraphKeys.TRAINABLE_VARIABLES`. This collection is used as
      the default list of variables to use by the `Optimizer` classes.
    dual_rate_factor: A floating point value or `Tensor`. The learning rate for
      the dual variable is scaled by this factor.

  Returns:
    dual_value: An op that computes the absolute value of the dual variable
      and reverses its gradient.
    dual_variable: The underlying variable itself.

        This magic command support two ways of activating debugger.
        One is to activate debugger before executing code.  This way, you
        can set a break point, to step through the code from the point.
        You can use this mode by giving statements to execute and optionally
        a breakpoint.

        The other one is to activate debugger in post-mortem mode.  You can
        activate this mode simply running %debug without any argument.
        If an exception has just occurred, this lets you inspect its stack
